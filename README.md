# titanic-data-mining

This repository hosts the code written by Francesco Marchisotti for the project presented during the exam of the [Data Mining: Statistical Modelling & Learning from Data](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/storicocorsi.pl/Show?_id=xnou_2324) course in the MSc [Physics of Complex Systems](https://fisica-sc.campusnet.unito.it/do/home.pl) at UniTo.

The dataset used for this project is the [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset) found on Kaggle.

The target of the project is to predict whether or not a passenger of the Titanic would survive based on the passenger data (name, age, gender, socio-economic class and so on).

If you are a fellow student and you'd like to use some of my code, please [send me an e-mail](mailto:francesco.marchisotti@gmail.com) first!
